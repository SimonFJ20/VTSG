# VTSG
My attempt at creating a simple-to-use 2d game engine to make 2d games to run in a brower

## Introduction
My goal with this game engine is to accomplish something that most other cant. It is to be able create 2d games at all sizes. Tools like Unity are can create much bigger and and better games, but it takes 2-3 months to learn. MIT Scratch on the other hand takes 1 minute to learn, but is so simple it is hard to create proper projects with it without working against it.
My goal with VTSG is a game engine that is simple enough to take a few hours to learn, but is powerfull enough to be able to create whatever the user wants to create.

I acknoledge the competition. P5js for example is a great tool to create games in JavaScript for browers, but P5js is mostly about drawing and simplifying. VTSG hopes to handle all things with a component based design. Maybe someday will VTSG use P5js, idk.
